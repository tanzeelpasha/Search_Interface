# Search_Interface
The project involves creating an interactive search interface designed to enhance user experience. It features a dropdown menu with various categories (Everything, Software Development, Web Development, Data Analyst, IT Consultant, Network Administrator) for users to filter search results, alongside a search input field for typing queries. A search button initiates the search process. The interface will be styled using CSS to ensure it is both visually appealing and user-friendly, aligning with the goals of the Web Development Internship Program.

The project involves developing a search interface with the following features:

- Dropdown Menu: Includes categories such as Everything, Software Development, Web Development, Data Analyst, IT Consultant, and Network Administrator. The dropdown should expand when clicked and collapse when a selection is made or when clicked outside the menu.

- Search Input Field: Allows users to enter their queries.

- Search Button: Initiates the search process.

- Styling: Use CSS to design the dropdown menu, search input field, and button to ensure the interface is visually appealing and user-friendly.
